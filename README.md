# mathlib-changelog

This Repo maintains an auto-updating list of the commits to [mathlib](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib) for [Lean](https://leanprover.github.io/) to have these in a searchable, indexable location.

Currently this just pulls in git commit messages, but as a future goal it would be great to automatically pull in lists of what lemmas and definitions were added/removed/changed as well.

The full changelog as plaintext is available in [CHANGELOG.full.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chanind/mathlib-changelog/main/CHANGELOG.full.txt), and markdown-formatted changelogs per month are available in the [markdown folder](https://github.com/chanind/mathlib-changelog/tree/main/markdown).
