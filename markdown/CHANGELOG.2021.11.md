chore(analysis/mean_inequalities[_pow]): use vector notation ([#10546](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/10546))
Several elementary inequalities in the library are expressed both in arbitrary n-ary versions and in explicit binary, ternary etc versions, with the latter deduced from the former.  This PR introduces vector notation to the proof terms deducing the latter from the former, which shortens them, and also makes them more readable.

chore(*): cleanup unneeded uses of by_cases across the library ([#10523](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/10523))
Many proofs in the library do case splits but then never use the introduced assumption in one of the cases, meaning the case split can be removed and replaced with the general argument.
Its easy to either accidentally introduce these more complicated than needed arguments when writing proofs, or in some cases presumably refactors made assumptions unnecessary, we golf / simplify several of these to simplify these proofs.
Similar things happen for `split_ifs` and explicit `if ... then` proofs.
Rather remarkably the changes to `uniformly_extend_spec` make the separated space assumption unnecessary too, and removing this removes this assumption from around 10 other lemmas in the library too.
Some more random golfs were added in the review process
Found with a work in progress linter.

doc(field_theory/galois): add comment that separable extensions are a‚Ä¶ ([#10500](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/10500))
‚Ä¶lgebraic
I teach my students that a Galois extension is algebraic, normal and separable, and was
just taken aback when I read the mathlib definition which omits "algebraic". Apparently
there are two conventions for the definition of separability, one implying algebraic and the other not:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separable_extension#Separability_of_transcendental_extensions .
Right now we have separability implies algebraic in mathlib so mathematically we're fine; I just
add a note to clarify what's going on. In particular if we act on the TODO in
the separability definition, we may (perhaps unwittingly) break the definition of
`is_galois`; hopefully this note lessens the chance that this happens.

The advantage of this is that `algebra.opposites` becomes a much lighter-weight import, allowing us to use the `has_mul` and `has_scalar` instance on opposite types earlier in the import hierarchy.
It also matches how we structure the instances on `prod` and `pi` types.

chore(analysis/normed_space/hahn_banach): remove `norm'` ([#10527](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/10527))
For a normed space over `‚Ñù`-algebra `ùïú`, `norm'` is currently defined to be `algebra_map ‚Ñù ùïú ‚à•x‚à•`.  I believe this was introduced before the `is_R_or_C` construct (including the coercion from `‚Ñù` to `ùïú` for `[is_R_or_C ùïú]`) joined mathlib.  Now that we have these things, it's easy to just say `(‚à•x‚à• : ùïú)` instead of `norm' ùïú ‚à•x‚à•`, so I don't really think `norm'` needs to exist any more.
(In principle, `norm'` is more general, since it works for all `‚Ñù`-algebras `ùïú` rather than just `[is_R_or_C ùïú]`.  But I can only really think of applications in the`is_R_or_C` case, and that's the only way it's used in the library.)

refactor(algebra.group.basic): Convert sub_add_cancel and neg_sub to multaplicative form ([#10419](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/10419))
Currently mathlib has a rich set of lemmas connecting the addition, subtraction and negation additive group operations, but a far thinner collection of results for multiplication, division and inverse multiplicative group operations, despite the fact that the former can be generated easily from the latter via `to_additive`.
In  [#9548](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/9548) I require multiplicative forms of the existing `sub_add_cancel` and `neg_sub` lemmas. This PR refactors them as the equivalent multiplicative results and then recovers `sub_add_cancel` and `neg_sub` via `to_additive`. There is a complication in that unfortunately `group_with_zero` already has lemmas named `inv_div` and `div_mul_cancel`. I have worked around this by naming the lemmas in this PR `inv_div'` and `div_mul_cancel'` and then manually overriding the names generated by `to_additive`. Other suggestions as to how to approach this welcome.

Rename `bounded_lattice` to `bounded_order`.
Split out `order_{top,bot}` and `bounded_order` from the order hierarchy.
That means that we no longer have `semilattice_{sup,inf}_{top,bot}`, but use the `[order_top]` as a mixin to `semilattice_inf`, for example.
Similarly, `lattice` and `bounded_order` instead of what was before `bounded_lattice`.

The main goal of this PR is the new lemma `affine_basis.det_smul_coords_eq_camer_coords`
A secondary goal is a minor refactor of barycentric coordinates so that they are associated to a new structure `affine_basis`. As well as making the API for affine spaces more similar to that of modules, this enables an extremely useful dot notation.
The work here could easily be split into two PRs and I will happily do so if requested.

‚Ä¶rties
Define the resolvent set and the spectrum of an element of an algebra as
a set of elements in the scalar ring. We prove a few basic facts
including that additive cosets of the spectrum commute with the
spectrum, that is, r + œÉ a = œÉ (r ‚¨ù 1 + a). Similarly, multiplicative
cosets of the spectrum also commute when the element r is a unit of
the scalar ring R. Finally, we also show that the units of R in

This splits out `group_theory.group_action.opposite` and `algebra.field.opposite` from `algebra.opposites`.
The motivation is to make opposite actions available slightly earlier in the import graph.
We probably want to split out `ring` at some point too, but that's likely a more annoying change so I've left it for future work.
These lemmas are just moved, and some `_root_` prefixes eliminated by removing the surrounding `namespace`.

This uses the new possibility to put urls in `undergrad.yaml` hoping to help describing what is meant to be formalized. We should probably create wiki pages for some cases that are not so clear even with a url. There is one case where I could find only a French page and some cases where I couldn't find anything. Amazingly "endormorphism exponential" is such a case, but hopefully this example is already clear. Another kind of problematic item is the "example" item in the representation section. Presumably it should be removed and replaced with a couple of explicit examples such as "standard representation of a matrix group" or "permutation representation".

This PR generalizes most of `linear_algebra/bilinear_map` to semilinear maps. Along the way, we introduce an instance for `module S (E ‚Üí‚Çõ‚Çó[œÉ] F)`, with `œÉ : R ‚Üí+* S`. This allows us to define "semibilinear" maps of type `E ‚Üí‚Çõ‚Çó[œÉ] F ‚Üí‚Çõ‚Çó[œÅ] G`, where `E`, `F` and `G` are modules over `R‚ÇÅ`, `R‚ÇÇ` and `R‚ÇÉ` respectively, and `œÉ : R‚ÇÅ ‚Üí+* R‚ÇÉ` and `œÅ : R‚ÇÇ ‚Üí+* R‚ÇÉ`. See `mk‚ÇÇ'‚Çõ‚Çó` to see how to construct such a map.

feat(measure_theory/covering/differentiation): differentiation of measures ([#10101](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/10101))
If `œÅ` and `Œº` are two Radon measures on a finite-dimensional normed real vector space, then for `Œº`-almost every `x`, the ratio `œÅ (B (x, r)) / Œº (B(x,r))` converges when `r` tends to `0`, towards the Radon-Nikodym derivative of `œÅ` with respect to `Œº`. This is the main theorem on differentiation of measures.
The convergence in fact holds for more general families of sets than balls, called Vitali families (the fact that balls form a Vitali family is a restatement of the Besicovitch covering theorem). The general version of the differentation of measures theorem is proved in this PR, following [Federer, geometric measure theory].

feat(*): Reduce imports to only those necessary in the entire library ([#10349](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/10349))
We reduce imports of many files in the library to only those actually needed by the content of the file, this is done by inspecting the declarations and attributes used by declarations in a file, and then computing a minimal set of imports that includes all of the necessary content. (A tool to do this was written by @jcommelin and I for this purpose).
The point of doing this is to reduce unnecessary recompilation when files that aren't needed for some file higher up the import graph are changed and everything in between gets recompiled. 
Another side benefit might be slightly faster simp / library_searches / tc lookups in some files as there may be less random declarations in the environment that aren't too relevant to the file.
The exception is that we do not remove any tactic file imports (in this run at least) as that requires more care to get right.
We also skip any `default.lean` files as the point of these is to provide a convenient way of importing a large chunk of the library (though arguably no mathlib file should import a default file that has no non-import content).
Some OLD statistics (not 100% accurate as several things changed since then):
The average number of imports of each file in the library reduces by around 2, (this equals the average number of dependencies of each file) raw numbers are `806748 / 2033` (total number of transitive links/total number files before) to `802710 / 2033` (after)
The length of the longest chain of imports in mathlib decreases from 139 to 130.
The imports (transitively) removed from the most from other files are as follows (file, decrease in number of files importing):
```
data.polynomial.degree.trailing_degree 13
linear_algebra.quotient 13
ring_theory.principal_ideal_domain 13
data.int.gcd 14
data.polynomial.div 14
data.list.rotate 15
data.nat.modeq 15
data.fin.interval 17
data.int.interval 17
data.pnat.interval 17
```
The original script generated by an import-reducing tool is at https://github.com/alexjbest/dag-tools though I did clean up the output and some weirdness after running this script
In touched files the imports are put into alphabetical order, we tried not to touch too many files that don't have their imports changed, but some were in the many merges and iterations on this.
There are a couple of changes to mathlib not to an import line (compared to master) that I couldn't resist doing that became apparent when the tool recommended deletions of imports containing named simp lemmas in the file, that weren't firing and so the tool was right to remove the import.
Another sort of issue  is discussed in https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/master/src/algebraic_geometry/presheafed_space/has_colimits.lean#L253, this is discussed at https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Reordering.20ext.20lemmas/near/261581547 and there seems to be currently no good way to avoid this so we just fix the proof. One can verify this with the command ` git diff origin/master -I import`
At a later point we hope to modify this tooling to suggest splits in long files by their prerequisites, but getting the library into a more minimal state w.r.t file imports seems to be important for such a tool to work well.

feat(field_theory/splitting_field): add a more general algebra instance as a def ([#10220](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/10220))
Unfortunately this def results in the following non-defeq diamonds in `splitting_field_aux.algebra` and `splitting_field.algebra`:
```lean
example
  (n : ‚Ñï) {K : Type u} [field K] {f : polynomial K} (hfn : f.nat_degree = n) :
    (add_comm_monoid.nat_module : module ‚Ñï (splitting_field_aux n f hfn)) =
  @algebra.to_module _ _ _ _ (splitting_field_aux.algebra n _ hfn) :=
rfl --fail
example : (add_comm_group.int_module _ : module ‚Ñ§ (splitting_field_aux n f hfn)) =
  @algebra.to_module _ _ _ _ (splitting_field_aux.algebra f) :=
rfl --fail
```
For this reason, we do not make `splitting_field.algebra` an instance by default. The `splitting_field_aux.algebra` instance is less harmful as it is an implementation detail.
However, the new def is still perfectly good for recovering the old less-general instance, and avoids the need for `restrict_scalars.algebra`.

This PR puts all results related to power functions into a new file.
Currently, we prove convexity of `exp` and `pow`, then use those properties in `mean_inequalities`. I am refactoring some parts of the analysis library to reduce the use of derivatives. I want to prove convexity of exp without derivatives (in a future PR), prove Holder's inequality, then use it to prove the convexity of pow. This requires Holder's inequality to be in a file that does not use convexity of pow, hence the split.
I needed to change the proof of Holder's inequality since it used the generalized mean inequality (hence `pow`). I switched to the second possible proof mentioned in the file docstring.
I also moved some lemmas in `mean_inequalities` to have three main sections: AM-GM, then Young and a final section with Holder and Minkowski.

feat(field_theory): define the field of rational functions `ratfunc` ([#9563](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/9563))
This PR defines `ratfunc K` as the field of rational functions over a field `K`, in terms of `fraction_ring (polynomial K)`. I have been careful to use `structure`s and `@[irreducible] def`s. Not only does that make for a nicer API, it also helps quite a bit with unification since the check can stop at `ratfunc` and doesn't have to start unfolding along the lines of `fraction_field.field ‚Üí localization.comm_ring ‚Üí localization.comm_monoid ‚Üí localization.has_mul` and/or `polynomial.integral_domain ‚Üí polynomial.comm_ring ‚Üí polynomial.ring ‚Üí polynomial.semiring`.
Most of the API is automatically derived from the (components of the) `is_fraction_ring` instance: the map `polynomial K ‚Üí ratpoly K` is `algebra_map`, the isomorphism to `fraction_ring (polynomial K)` is `is_localization.alg_equiv`, ...
As a first application to verify that the definitions work, I rewrote `function_field` in terms of `ratfunc`.

We clean up some specific statements that are essentially no-ops in the library, i.e. opening a namespace and then never using it and using a simp-set larger than actually needed.
This is a preparatory miscellany of small fixes for a larger PR upcoming from me and Johan to reduce imports in the library.

It's been three years since this was discussed according to the zulip archive link in the library note.
According to CI, the reason is no longer relevant. Leaving these as `noncomputable lemma` is harmful as it results in non-defeq instance diamonds sometimes as lean was not able to unfold the lemmas to get to the data underneath.
Since these are now `def`s, the linter requires them to have docstrings.

This also moves the group structure on linear_equiv earlier in the import heirarchy.

This file adds the construction of `P‚Å∫`, for a presheaf `P : C·µí·µñ ‚•§ D`, whenever `C` has a Grothendieck topology `J` and `D` has the appropriate (co)limits.
Later, we will show that `P‚Å∫‚Å∫` is the sheafification of `P`, under certain additional hypotheses on `D`.

refactor(linear_algebra/eigenspace): refactor `eigenvectors_linearly_independent` ([#10198](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/10198))

```lean
lemma eigenvectors_linear_independent (f : End K V) (Œºs : set K) (xs : Œºs ‚Üí V)
  (h_eigenvec : ‚àÄ Œº : Œºs, f.has_eigenvector Œº (xs Œº)) :

to extract the formulation
```lean
lemma eigenspaces_independent (f : End K V) : complete_lattice.independent f.eigenspace

refactor(order): order_{top,bot} as mixin ([#10097](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/10097))
This changes `order_top Œ±` / `order_bot Œ±` to _require_ `has_le Œ±` instead of _extending_ `partial_order Œ±`.
As a result, `order_top` can be combined with other lattice typeclasses. This lends itself to more refactors downstream, such as phrasing lemmas that currently require orders/semilattices and top/bot to provide them as separate TC inference, instead of "bundled" classes like `semilattice_inf_top`.
This refactor also provides the basis for making more consistent the "extended" algebraic classes, like "e(nn)real", "enat", etc. Some proof terms for lemmas about `nnreal` and `ennreal` have been switched to rely on more direct coercions from the underlying non-extended type or other (semi)rings.
Modify `semilattice_{inf,sup}_{top,bot}` to not directly inherit from
`order_{top,bot}`. Instead, they are now extending from `has_{top,bot}`. Extending `order_{top,bot}` is now only possible is `has_le` is provided to the TC cache at `extends` declaration time, when using `old_structure_cmd true`. That is,
```
set_option old_structure_cmd true
class mnwe (Œ± : Type u) extends semilattice_inf Œ±, order_top Œ±.
```
errors with
```
type mismatch at application
  @semilattice_inf.to_partial_order Œ± top
term
  top
has type
  Œ±
but is expected to have type
  semilattice_inf Œ±
```
One can make this work through one of three ways:
No `old_structure_cmd`, which is unfriendly to the rest of the class hierarchy
Require `has_le` in `class mwe (Œ± : Type u) [has_le Œ±] extends semilattice_inf Œ±, order_top Œ±.`, which is unfriendly to the existing hierarchy and how lemmas are stated.
Provide an additional axiom on top of a "data-only" TC and have a low-priority instance:
```
class semilattice_inf_top (Œ± : Type u) extends semilattice_inf Œ±, has_top Œ± :=
(le_top : ‚àÄ a : Œ±, a ‚â§ ‚ä§)
@[priority 100]
instance semilattice_inf_top.to_order_top : order_top Œ± :=
{ top := ‚ä§,  le_top := semilattice_inf_top.le_top }
```
The third option is chosen in this refactor.
Pulled out from [#9891](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/9891), without the semilattice refactor.

feat(ring_theory/ideal/over): algebra structure on R/p ‚Üí S/P for `P` lying over `p` ([#9858](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/9858))
This PR shows `P` lies over `p` if there is an injective map completing the square `R/p ‚Üê R ‚Äîf‚Üí S ‚Üí S/P`, and conversely that there is a (not necessarily injective, since `f` doesn't have to be) map completing the square if `P` lies over `p`. Then we specialize this to the case where `P = map f p` to provide an `algebra p.quotient (map f p).quotient` instance.
This algebra instance is useful if you want to study the extension `R ‚Üí S` locally at `p`, e.g. to show `R/p : S/pS` has the same dimension as `Frac(R) : Frac(S)` if `p` is prime.

We prove that the norm equals the product of the embeddings in an algebraically closed field.
Note that we follow a slightly different path than for the trace, since transitivity of the norm is more delicate, and we avoid it.
From flt-regular.

refactor(data/nat/interval): simp for Ico_zero_eq_range ([#10211](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/10211))
This PR makes two changes: It refactors `nat.Ico_zero_eq_range` from `Ico 0 a = range a` to `Ico 0 = range`, and makes the lemma a simp lemma.
These changes feel good to me, but feel free to close this if this is not the direction we want to go with this lemma.

chore(topology/algebra/mul_action): define `has_continuous_vadd` using `to_additive` ([#10227](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/10227))
Make additive version of the theory of `has_continuous_smul`, i.e., `has_continuous_vadd`, using `to_additive`.  I've been fairly conservative in adding `to_additive` tags -- I left them off lemmas that didn't seem like they'd be relevant for typical additive actions, like those about `units` or `group_with_zero`.
Also make `normed_add_torsor` an instance of `has_continuous_vadd` and use this to establish some of its continuity API.

chore(set_theory/cardinal): more simp, fix LHS/RHS ([#10212](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/10212))
While `coe (fintype.card Œ±)` is a larger expression than `#Œ±`, it allows us to compute the cardinality of a finite type provided that we have a `simp` lemma for `fintype.card Œ±`. It also plays well with lemmas about coercions from `nat` and `cardinal.lift`.
* rename `cardinal.fintype_card` to `cardinal.mk_fintype`, make it a `@[simp]` lemma;
* deduce other cases (`bool`, `Prop`, `unique`, `is_empty`) from it;
* rename `cardinal.finset_card` to `cardinal.mk_finset`, swap LHS/RHS;
* rename `ordinal.fintype_card` to `ordinal.type_fintype`.

feat(linear_algebra/multilinear/basis): multilinear maps on basis vectors ([#10090](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/10090))
Add two versions of the fact that a multilinear map on finitely many
arguments is determined by its values on basis vectors.  The precise
requirements for each version follow from the results used in the
proof: `basis.ext_multilinear_fin` uses the `curry` and `uncurry`
results to deduce it from `basis.ext` and thus works for multilinear
maps on a family of modules indexed by `fin n`, while
`basis.ext_multilinear` works for an arbitrary `fintype` index type
but is limited to the case where the modules for all the arguments
(and the bases used for those modules) are the same, since it's
derived from the previous result using `dom_dom_congr` which only
handles the case where all the modules are the same.
This is in preparation for proving a corresponding result for
alternating maps, for which the case of all argument modules the same
suffices.
There is probably room for making results more general.

This also tidies up some variables and consistently uses `B` instead of `S` for the second algebra.
One proof in `ring_theory/finiteness.lean` has to be redone because typeclass search times out where it previously did not.
Thankfully, the new proof is shorter anyway.

The lemma `inv_eq_nonsing_inv_of_invertible` has been renamed to `inv_of_eq_nonsing_inv`
This also adds two new lemmas `inv_of_eq` and `det_inv_of`, both of which have trivial proofs.

feat(measure_theory/covering/vitali_family): define Vitali families ([#10057](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/10057))
Vitali families are families of sets (for instance balls around each point in vector spaces) that satisfy covering theorems. Their main feature is that differentiation of measure theorems hold along Vitali families. This PR is a stub defining Vitali families, and giving examples of them thanks to the Besicovitch and Vitali covering theorems.
The differentiation theorem is left for another PR.

refactor(analysis/calculus/mean_value): Remove useless hypotheses ([#10129](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/10129))
Because the junk value of `deriv` is `0`, assuming `‚àÄ x, 0 < deriv f x` implies that `f` is derivable. We thus remove all those redundant derivability assumptions.

refactor(algebra/direct_sum): rework internally-graded objects ([#10127](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/10127))
This is a replacement for the `graded_ring.core` typeclass in [#10115](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/10115), which is called `set_like.graded_monoid` here. The advantage of this approach is that we can use the same typeclass for graded semirings, graded rings, and graded algebras.
Largely, this change replaces a bunch of `def`s with `instances`, by bundling up the arguments to those defs to a new typeclass. This seems to make life easier for the few global `gmonoid` instance we already provide for direct sums of submodules, suggesting this API change is a useful one.
In principle the new `[set_like.graded_monoid A]` typeclass is useless, as the same effect can be achieved with `[set_like.has_graded_one A] [set_like.has_graded_mul A]`; pragmatically though this is painfully verbose, and probably results in larger term sizes. We can always remove it later if it causes problems.

feat(measure_theory/decomposition/lebesgue): more on Radon-Nikodym derivatives ([#10070](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/10070))
We show that the density in the Lebesgue decomposition theorem (aka the Radon-Nikodym derivative) is unique. Previously, uniqueness of the absolutely continuous part was known, but not of its density. We also show that the Radon-Nikodym derivative is almost everywhere finite. Plus some cleanup of the whole file.

feat(data/mv_polynomial/basic): lemmas about map ([#10092](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/10092))
This adds `map_alg_hom`, which fills the gap between `map` and `map_alg_equiv`.
The only new proof here is `map_surjective`; everything else is just a reworked existing proof.

refactor(order/bounded_lattice): generalize le on with_{top,bot} ([#10085](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/10085))
Before, some lemmas assumed `preorder` even when they were true for
just the underlying `le`. In the case of `with_bot`, the missing
underlying `has_le` instance is defined.
For both `with_{top,bot}`, a few lemmas are generalized accordingly.

refactor(algebra/algebra): remove subalgebra.under ([#10081](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/10081))
This removes `subalgebra.under`, and replaces `subalgebra.of_under` with `subalgebra.of_restrict_scalars`.
Lemmas associated with `under` have been renamed accordingly.

feat(topology/algebra/ordered/liminf_limsup): convergence of a sequence which does not oscillate infinitely ([#10073](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/10073))
If, for all `a < b`, a sequence is not frequently below `a` and frequently above `b`, then it has to converge. This is a useful convergence criterion (called no upcrossings), used for instance in martingales.
Also generalize several statements on liminfs and limsups from complete linear orders to conditionally complete linear orders.

chore(coinductive_predicates): remove private and use of import_private ([#10084](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/10084))
Remove a `private` modifier (I think this had previously been ported from core by @bryangingechen).
Then remove the only use of `import_private` from the library. (Besides another use in `tests/`, which we're not porting.)
(In mathlib4 we have `OpenPrivate` as an alternative. Removing `import_private` is one less thing for mathport to care about.)

We should probably remove `subalgebra.under` entirely, but that's likely a lot more work.

chore(analysis/normed_space/operator_norm): semilinearize part of the file ([#10076](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/10076))
This PR generalizes part of the `operator_norm` file to semilinear maps. Only the first section (`semi_normed`) is done, which allows us to construct continuous semilinear maps using `linear_map.mk_continuous`.
The rest of the file is trickier, since we need specify how the ring hom interacts with the norm. I'd rather leave it to a future PR since I don't need the rest now.

feat(algebra/direct_sum/module) : coe and internal ([#10004](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/10004))
This extracts the following `def`s from within the various `is_internal` properties:
* `direct_sum.add_submonoid_coe`
* `direct_sum.add_subgroup_coe`
* `direct_sum.submodule_coe`
Packing these into a def makes things more concise, and avoids some annoying elaboration issues.
