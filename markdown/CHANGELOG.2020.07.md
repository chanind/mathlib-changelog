feat(tactic/explode): support exploding "let" expressions and improve handling of "have" expressions ([#3632](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/3632))
The current #explode has little effect on proofs using "let" expressions, e.g., #explode nat.exists_infinite_primes. #explode also
occasionally ignores certain dependencies due to macros occurring in "have" expressions. See examples below. This PR fixes these issues.

Œª hp, have hh : p, from hp, hh
#explode foo -- missing dependencies at forall introduction

but ... maybe one day.

A while back @gebner identified that [an unfortunate timeout could be avoided](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/3380#issuecomment-657449148) by making `polynomial.eval2` irreducible.
This PR does that.
It's not perfect: on a few occasions I have to temporarily set it back to semireducible, because it looks like the proofs really do some heavy refling.
I'd like to make more things irreducible in the polynomial API, but not yet.

feat(topology/tactic): continuity faster and more powerful ([#3545](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/3545))
Following up on the recent introduction of Reid's continuity tactic in [#2879](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/2879), I've made some tweaks that make it both faster and more capable.
1. we use `apply_rules {md:=semireducible}`, taking advantage of [#3538](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/3538). This makes examples like
`example : continuous (Œª x : ‚Ñù, exp ((max x (-x)) + sin (cos x))^2) := by continuity` viable.
2. in `apply_rules`, if we pull in lemmas using an attribute, we reverse the list of lemmas (on the heuristic that older lemmas are more frequently applicable than newer lemmas)
3. in `continuity`, I removed the `apply_assumption` step in the `tidy` loop, since `apply_rules` is already calling `assumption`
4. also in the `tidy` loop, I moved `intro1` above `apply_rules`.
The example in the test file

feat(tactic/simps): improvements ([#3477](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/3477))
Features:
* `@[simps]` will look for `has_coe_to_sort` and `has_coe_to_fun` instances, and use those instead of direct projections. This should make it way more applicable for `equiv`, `local_equiv` and all other structures that coerce to a function (and for the few structures that coerce to a type). This works out-of-the-box without special configuration.
* Use `has_mul.mul`, `has_zero.zero` and all the other "notation projections" instead of the projections directly. This should make it more useful in category theory and the algebraic hierarchy (note: the `[notation_class]` attribute still needs to be added to all notation classes not defined in `init.core`)
* Add an easy way to specify custom projections of structures (like using `‚áëe.symm` instead of `e.inv_fun`). They have to be definitionally equal to the projection.
Minor changes:
* Change the syntax to specify options.
* `prod` (and `pprod`) are treated as a special case: we do not recursively apply projections of these structure. This was the most common reason that we had to write the desired projections manually. You can still override this behavior by writing out the projections manually.
* A flag to apply `simp` to the rhs of the generated lemma, so that they are in simp-normal-form.
* Added an options to add more attributes to the generated lemmas
* Added an option which definitions to unfold to determine whether a type is a function type. By default it will unfold reducible definitions and instances (but e.g. not `set Œ±`)
* Added an option to unfold definitions in the declaration to determine whether it is a constructor. (default: none)
* Added an option to not fully-apply the terms in the generated lemmas.
Design decisions:
* For every field in a structure there is a specified "projection expression" that acts as the projection for that field. For most fields this is just the projection of the structure, but this will be automatically overridden under certain conditions, like a coercion to functions/sorts existing, or a notation typeclass existing for a certain field.
* The first time you call `simps` for a specific structure, these projection expressions are cached using an attribute for that structure, and it is assumed you want to use the same projection expressions every time.
* You can also manually specify the projection. See Note [custom simps projection].

chore(algebraic_geometry/presheafed_space): use projection rather than fancy coercion ([#3507](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/3507))
We'd gone to great effort when writing `PresheafedSpace` to create a coercion from morphisms of `PresheafedSpace`s to morphisms in `Top`.
It's hard to read, it's fragile.
So this PR rips out that coercion, and renames the "continuous map between base spaces" field from `f` to `base`, and uses that throughout.

This allows passing an `apply_cfg` argument to `apply_rules` (and simplifies the configuration argument to `solve_by_elim`).

chore(*): remove `plift` from some lemmas about `infi`/`supr` ([#3503](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/3503))
Now `supr_eq_supr_finset` etc assume `Œπ` is a `Type*` and don't use `plift`. If you want
to apply it to a `Sort*`, rewrite on `equiv.plift.surjective.supr_comp` first.
## Full list of API changes:
### `data/equiv/basic`
* `equiv.ulift`: change the order of universe arguments to match `ulift`;
* add `coe_ulift`, `coe_plift`, `coe_ulift_symm`, `coe_plift_symm`;
### `data/finset/lattice`
* `supr_eq_supr_finset`, `infi_eq_infi_finset`: assume `Œπ` is a `Type*`, avoid `plift`;
* `Union_eq_Union_finset`, `Inter_eq_Inter_finset`: same as above;
### `data/set/basic`
* `function.surjective.range_comp`: generalize to `Sort*` for 2 of 3 arguments;
### `order/complete_lattice`
* remove `supr_congr` and `infi_congr`;
* add `function.surjective.supr_comp` and `function.surjective.infi_comp`.

feat(ring_theory/ideal_over): a prime ideal lying over a maximal ideal is maximal ([#3488](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/3488))
By making the results in `ideal_over.lean` a bit more general, we can transfer to quotient rings. This allows us to prove a strict inclusion `I < J` of ideals in `S` results in a strict inclusion `I.comap f < J.comap f` if `R` if `f : R ->+* S` is nice enough. As a corollary, a prime ideal lying over a maximal ideal is maximal.

This builds on [#3407](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/3407), trying to get related material closer together. 
There shouldn't be any change to the set of declarations, just the order they come in and the imports required to get them.
The major changes are:
1. `data.polynomial.derivative` now has much weaker imports
2. generally, material has been moved "upwards" to the first place it can be done (a lot of material moved out of `data.polynomial.degree` into `data.polynomial.degree.basic` -- essentially `degree` is the material about `degree` that also needs `eval` and friends; a further rename might be appropriate)
3. some of the later material is no longer a big chain of linear dependencies, but compiles separately

chore(topology/category/): switch to bundled morphisms in Top ([#3506](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/3506))
This is a natural follow-up to @Nicknamen's recent PRs splitting bundled continuous maps out of `compact_open`.
There is a slight regression in `algebraic_geometry.presheafed_space` and `algebraic_geometry.stalks`, requiring a more explicit coercion. I'd encourage reviewers to ignore this, as I'll make a separate PR simplifying this (basically: having a coercion from morphisms of `PresheafedSpace`s to morphisms of `Top`s is unrealistically ambitious, and moreover harder to read, than just using the projection notation, and removing it makes everything easier).

feat(data/list/basic): induction from both ends ([#3448](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/3448))
This was originally an induction principle on palindromes, but researching Coq solutions made me realize that weakening the statement made it simpler and much easier to prove.
- ["The way we proceeded was to prove first an induction principle for lists, considering insertions at both ends..."][1]
- ["... generalizing a single variable in that definition would create another inductive definition of a list."][2]

This also adds the lemmas `length_init` and `init_append_last`.

refactor(ring_theory): remove unbundled leftovers in `ideal.quotient` ([#3467](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/3467))
This PR aims to smooth some corners in the `ideal.quotient` namespace left by the move to bundled `ring_hom`s. The main irritation is the ambiguity between different ways to map `x : R` to the quotient ring: `quot.mk`, `quotient.mk`, `quotient.mk'`, `submodule.quotient.mk`, `ideal.quotient.mk` and `ideal.quotient.mk_hom`, which caused a lot of duplication and more awkward proofs.
The specific changes are:
 * delete function `ideal_quotient.mk`
 * rename ring hom `ideal.quotient.mk_hom` to `ideal.quotient.mk`
 * make new `ideal_quotient.mk` the `simp` normal form
 * delete obsolete `mk_eq_mk_hom`
 * delete obsolete `mk_...` `simp` lemmas (use `ring_hom.map_...` instead)
 * delete `quotient.map_mk` which was unused and had no lemmas (`ideal.map quotient.mk` is used elsewhere)

This essentially ports over the fix from `solve_by_elim`: rather than carrying around a `list expr`, we carry a `list (tactic expr)` and generate on demand.

feat(geometry/manifold/times_cont_mdiff): smooth functions between manifolds ([#3387](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/3387))
We define smooth functions between smooth manifolds, and prove their basic properties (including the facts that a composition of smooth functions is smooth, and that the tangent map of a smooth map is smooth).
To avoid reproving always the same stuff in manifolds, we build a general theory of local invariant properties in the model space (i.e., properties which are local, and invariant under the structure groupoids) and show that the lift of such properties to charted spaces automatically inherit all the good behavior of the original property. We apply this general machinery to prove most basic properties of smooth functions between manifolds.

feat(ring_theory/ideal_over): lemmas for nonzero ideals lying over nonzero ideals ([#3385](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/3385))
Let `f` be a ring homomorphism from `R` to `S` and `I` be an ideal in `S`. To show that `I.comap f` is not the zero ideal, we can show `I` contains a non-zero root of some non-zero polynomial `p : polynomial R`. As a corollary, if `S` is algebraic over `R` (e.g. the integral closure of `R`), nonzero ideals in `S` lie over nonzero ideals in `R`.
I created a new file because `integral_closure.comap_ne_bot` depends on `comap_ne_bot_of_algebraic_mem`, but `ring_theory/algebraic.lean` imports `ring_theory/integral_closure.lean` and I didn't see any obvious join in the dependency graph where they both belonged.

* Define a typeclass `closed_under_restriction` for structure groupoids.
* Prove that it is equivalent to requiring that the structure groupoid contain all local homeomorphisms equivalent to the restriction of the identity to an open subset.
* Verify that `continuous_groupoid` and `times_cont_diff_groupoid` satisfy `closed_under_restriction`.  
* Show that a charted space defined by a single chart is `has_groupoid` for any structure groupoid satisfying `closed_under_restriction`.

This simplifies `¬¨ (p ‚àß q)` to `(p ‚Üí ¬¨ q)` instead of `¬¨ p ‚à® ¬¨ q`. This has better behavior when going between `\forall x, P -> Q` and `\exists x, P /\ Q'` where `Q` and `Q'` are opposite.

feat(algebra/category/*): get rid of the local reducible hack ([#3354](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/3354))
I thought I did this back in April, but apparently never made the PR.
We currently use a strange hack when setting up concrete categories, making them locally reducible. There's a library note about this, which ends:
```
TODO: Probably @[derive] should be able to create instances of the	
required form (without `id`), and then we could use that instead of	
this obscure `local attribute [reducible]` method.
```
This PR makes the small change required to `delta_instance` to make this happen, and then stops using the hack in setting up concrete categories (and deletes the library note explaining this hack).

chore(*): import tactic.basic as early as possible, and reduce imports ([#3333](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/3333))
As discussed on [zulip](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/import.20refactor.20and.20library_search), [#3235](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/3235) had the unfortunate effect of making `library_search` and `#where` and various other things unavailable in many places in mathlib.
This PR makes an effort to import `tactic.basic` as early as possible, while otherwise reducing unnecessary imports. 
1. import `tactic.basic` "as early as possible" (i.e. in any file that `tactic.basic` doesn't depend on, and which imports any tactic strictly between `tactic.core` and `tactic.basic`, just `import tactic.basic` itself
2. add `tactic.finish`, `tactic.tauto` and `tactic.norm_cast` to tactic.basic (doesn't requires adding any dependencies)
3. delete various unnecessary imports

fix(tactic/norm_cast): remove bad norm_cast lemma ([#3340](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/3340))
This was identified as a move_cast lemma, which meant it was rewriting to the LHS which it couldn't reduce. It's better to let the conditional rewriting handle nat subtraction -- if the right inequality is in the context there's no need to go to `int.sub_nat_nat`.

chore(*): use is_algebra_tower instead of algebra.comap and generalize some constructions to semirings ([#3299](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/3299))
`algebra.comap` is now reserved to the **creation** of new algebra instances. For assumptions of theorems / constructions, `is_algebra_tower` is the new way to do it. For example:
```lean

lemma is_algebraic_trans (L_alg : is_algebraic K L) (A_alg : is_algebraic L A) :
  is_algebraic K (comap K L A) :=
```
is now written as:
```lean
variables [algebra K L] [algebra L A] [algebra K A] [is_algebra_tower K L A]
lemma is_algebraic_trans (L_alg : is_algebraic K L) (A_alg : is_algebraic L A) :

Previously, all of the "special shapes" that happened to be finite imported `category_theory.limits.shapes.finite_limits`. Now it's the other way round, which I think ends up being cleaner.
This also results in some significant reductions to the dependency graph (e.g. talking about homology of complexes no longer requires compiling `data.fintype.basic` and all its antecedents).

feat(topology/metric_space/basic): add closed_ball_mem_nhds ([#3305](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/3305))
I found this lemma handy when converting between the epsilon-N definition of convergence and the filter definition

feat(data/list/defs): list.singleton_append and list.bind_singleton ([#3298](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/3298))
I found these useful when working with palindromes and Fibonacci words respectively.
While `bind_singleton` is available as a monad law, I find the specialized version more convenient.

feat(analysis/normed_space/operator_norm): normed algebra of continuous linear maps ([#3282](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/3282))
Given a normed space `E`, its continuous linear endomorphisms form a normed ring, and a normed algebra if `E` is nonzero.  Moreover, the units of this ring are precisely the continuous linear equivalences.

I have two goals:
* make it possible to refactor `set` to use `lattice` operations;
* make `submonoid.basic` independent of `data.nat.basic`.

feat(linear_algebra/affine_space): lattice structure on affine subspaces ([#3288](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/3288))
Define a `complete_lattice` instance on affine subspaces of an affine
space, and prove a few basic lemmas relating to it.  (There are plenty
more things that could be proved about it, that I think can reasonably
be added later.)

### [2020-07-06 16:58:21](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/commit/f06e4e0)
feat(data/sym2) Defining the symmetric square (unordered pairs) ([#3264](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/3264))
This adds a type for the symmetric square of a type, which is the quotient of the cartesian square by permutations.  These are also known as unordered pairs.
Additionally, this provides some definitions and lemmas for equalities, functoriality, membership, and a relationship between symmetric relations and terms of the symmetric square.
I preferred `sym2` over `unordered_pairs` out of a combination of familiarity and brevity, but I could go either way for naming.

### [2020-07-06 15:34:25](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/commit/e3a1a61)
feat(tactic/interactive): identity tactic ([#3295](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/3295))
A surprisingly missing tactic combinator.

### [2020-07-06 14:12:29](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/commit/33b6cba)
refactor(*): replace nonzero with nontrivial ([#3296](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/3296))
Introduce a typeclass `nontrivial` saying that a type has at least two distinct elements, and use it instead of the predicate `nonzero` requiring that `0` is different from `1`. These two predicates are equivalent in monoids with zero, which cover essentially all relevant ring-like situations, but `nontrivial` applies also to say that a vector space is nontrivial, for instance.
Along the way, fix some quirks in the alebraic hierarchy (replacing fields `zero_ne_one` in many structures with extending `nontrivial`, for instance). Also, `quadratic_reciprocity` was timing out. I guess it was just below the threshold before the refactoring, and some of the changes related to typeclass inference made it just above after the change. So, I squeeze_simped it, going from 47s to 1.7s on my computer.

feat(analysis/normed_space/*): group of units of a normed ring is open ([#3210](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/3210))
In a complete normed ring, the group of units is an open subset of the ring ([Zulip](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/Inversion.20is.20analytic))
Supporting material:

* `analysis.normed_space.basic`, `normed_space.operator_norm`: left- and right- multiplication in a normed ring (algebra) is a bounded homomorphism (linear map); the algebra/linear-map versions are not needed for the main result but included for completeness
* `analysis.normed_space.basic`: a normed algebra is `nonzero` (not needed for the main result) ([Zulip](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new-members/topic/Dangerous.20instance))

feat(ring_theory/polynomial): rational root theorem and integral root theorem ([#3241](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/3241))
Prove the rational root theorem for a unique factorization domain `A`: Let `K` be the field of fractions of `A` and `p` a polynomial over `A`. If `x : K` is a root of `p`, then the numerator of `x` divides the constant coefficient and the denominator of `x` divides the leading coefficient. (This required defining the numerator and denominator.) As a corollary we have the integral root theorem: if `p` is monic, then its roots in `K` are in fact elements of `A`. As a second corollary, the integral closure of `A` in `K` is `A` itself.

feat(analysic/calculus/times_cont_diff): add times_cont_diff_within_at ([#3262](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/3262))
I want to refactor manifolds, defining local properties in the model space and showing that they automatically inherit nice behavior in manifolds. 
In this PR, we modify a little bit the definition of smooth functions in vector spaces by introducing a predicate `times_cont_diff_within_at` (just like we already have `continuous_within_at` or `differentiable_within_at`) and using it in all definitions and proofs. This will be the basis of the locality argument in manifolds.

feat(data/real/cardinality): cardinalities of intervals of reals ([#3252](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/3252))
Use the existing result `mk_real` to deduce corresponding results for
all eight kinds of intervals of reals.
It's convenient for this result to add a new lemma to
`data.set.intervals.image_preimage` about the image of an interval
under `inv`.  Just as there are only a few results there about images
of intervals under multiplication rather than a full set, so I just
added the result I needed rather than all the possible variants.  (I
think there are something like 36 reasonable variants of that lemma
that could be stated, for (image or preimage - the same thing in this
case, but still separate statements) x (interval in positive or
negative reals) x (end closer to 0 is 0 (open), nonzero (open) or
nonzero (closed)) x (other end is open, closed or infinite).)

chore(algebra/*): deduplicate `*_with_zero`/`semiring`/`field` ([#3259](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/3259))
All moved/renamed/merged lemmas were generalized to use
`*_with_zero`/`nonzero`/`mul_zero_class` instead of
`(semi)ring`/`division_ring`/`field`.
## Moved to `group_with_zero`
The following lemmas were formulated for
`(semi_)ring`s/`division_ring`s/`field`s. Some of them had strictly
more general ‚Äúprime‚Äù versions for `*_with_zero`. I either moved a
lemma to `algebra/group_with_zero` and adjusted the requirements or
removed the non-prime version and `'` from the name of the prime
version. Sometimes I also made some arguments implicit.
TL;DR: moved to `group_with_zero`, removed `name'` lemma if it was there.

* `not_is_unit_zero`;
* `div_eq_one_iff_eq`;

  left/right multiplication by a non-zero element is injective; the

chore(*): work on removing deprecated is_X_hom typeclasses ([#3258](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/3258))
It's far from over, but as I was bumping up against issues in `polynomial.lean` and `mv_polynomial.lean`, I'm going to PR this part for now, and then wait to return to it when other PRs affecting `polynomial.lean` have cleared.

chore(data/finset, data/multiset): split into smaller files ([#3256](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/3256))
This follows on from [#2341](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/2341), which split the second half of `data.list.basic` into separate files. This now does the same (trying to follow a similar split) for `data.multiset` and `data.finset`.

feat(category/preadditive): properties of preadditive biproducts ([#3245](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/3245))
### Basic facts about morphisms between biproducts in preadditive categories.
* In any category (with zero morphisms), if `biprod.map f g` is an isomorphism,
  then both `f` and `g` are isomorphisms.
The remaining lemmas hold in any preadditive category.
* If `f` is a morphism `X‚ÇÅ ‚äû X‚ÇÇ ‚ü∂ Y‚ÇÅ ‚äû Y‚ÇÇ` whose `X‚ÇÅ ‚ü∂ Y‚ÇÅ` entry is an isomorphism,
  then we can construct isomorphisms `L : X‚ÇÅ ‚äû X‚ÇÇ ‚âÖ X‚ÇÅ ‚äû X‚ÇÇ` and `R : Y‚ÇÅ ‚äû Y‚ÇÇ ‚âÖ Y‚ÇÅ ‚äû Y‚ÇÇ`
  so that `L.hom ‚â´ g ‚â´ R.hom` is diagonal (with `X‚ÇÅ ‚ü∂ Y‚ÇÅ` component still `f`),
  via Gaussian elimination.
* As a corollary of the previous two facts,
  if we have an isomorphism `X‚ÇÅ ‚äû X‚ÇÇ ‚âÖ Y‚ÇÅ ‚äû Y‚ÇÇ` whose `X‚ÇÅ ‚ü∂ Y‚ÇÅ` entry is an isomorphism,
  we can construct an isomorphism `X‚ÇÇ ‚âÖ Y‚ÇÇ`.
* If `f : W ‚äû X ‚ü∂ Y ‚äû Z` is an isomorphism, either `ùüô W = 0`,
  or at least one of the component maps `W ‚ü∂ Y` and `W ‚ü∂ Z` is nonzero.
* If `f : ‚®Å S ‚ü∂ ‚®Å T` is an isomorphism,
  then every column (corresponding to a nonzero summand in the domain)
  has some nonzero matrix entry.
This PR is preliminary to some work on semisimple categories.
